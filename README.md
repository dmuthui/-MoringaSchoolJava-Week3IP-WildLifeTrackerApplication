## Description

This project is my week three Java IP about Wildlife Tracker App.

## What is Wildlife Tracker App?
The Forest Service is considering a proposal from a timber company to clearcut a nearby forest of Douglas Fir. Before this proposal may be approved, they must complete an environmental impact study.In this regards,the app has been developed.
The Wildlife Tracker App is a web application built to help Rangers track wildlife sightings in a specific area. The application allows Rangers to record sightings of animals and endangered animals, along with relevant information such as location and Ranger details. It also provides features like reporting exceptions and storing timestamps for each sighting.


## BDD
Categories of Wildlife
The application tracks two categories of wildlife:
Animals:
ID
Name

Endangered Animals:
ID
Name
Health (Options: "healthy", "ill", "okay")
Age (Options: "newborn", "young", "adult")

Sightings
When a wildlife species is spotted, a Ranger can submit a Sighting form containing the following details:
ID of Animal or Endangered Animal species
Location (Conveyed in any manner chosen, e.g., "Zone A", "Near the River", "NE Quadrant", or latitude and longitude values)
Ranger Name

## Steps for the problem
The application tracks two categories of wildlife:
Animals:
ID

## **Expected output is either**
The user should be able to enter an animal,endangered animal and allow report/record a sighting as below:
Enter Regular animals name

Enter Endangered Animals:
Name
Health (Options: "healthy", "ill", "okay")
Age (Options: "newborn", "young", "adult")

Regular animal or Endangered Animal species
Location (Conveyed in any manner chosen, e.g., "Zone A", "Near the River", "NE Quadrant", or latitude and longitude values)
Ranger Name:Ranger's details should include contact information, a badge number, etc

## Setup/Installation Requirements
